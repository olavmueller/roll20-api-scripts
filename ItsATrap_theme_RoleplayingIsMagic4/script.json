For the purpose of this script, a character's passive Perception is\rcalculated as follows:\r\r```\r4 + (total Advantage/Disadvantage modifier) + Mind + (3 if trained) + (2 if improved) + (1 if greater) + (total Misc modifiers)\r```\r\rSo for example, a character not trained in Perception with a Mind of 2 would\rhave a passive Perception of 6. A character trained in Perception with a Mind\rof 4 would have a passive Perception of 11.\r",
