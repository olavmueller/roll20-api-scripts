    "description": "# It's A Trap!\r\r###### Updates\r\r_3.0_\r* Traps are now modified through a chat menu instead of editing the JSON by hand.\r* Traps can now be disabled so that they won't activate but can still be spotted.\r* There is now an option to reveal the trap token when it is spotted. This, along with the disable option, can be used to create hidden things that are not necessarily traps such as secret doors.\r* The script exposes a TrapTheme base class.\r* The script exposes a TrapEffect class.\r* Fixed 'revealTrapsToMap' user option bug.\r* Fixed 'GM Only' output bug.\r* Note: Some things have been deprecated and some interfaces have been changed in this version, which is why I decided to bump up its major version. On that note, TrapThemes created for v2.X are no longer compatible. Please use v3.X TrapThemes with this new version.\r\rThis is a script that allows GMs to quickly and very easily set up traps on\rthe GM layer, and detect when tokens on the objects layer move over them. This\rtrap detection even works for tokens moving by waypoints.\r\r### Creating traps:\r\rPlace the token for your trap on the ```GM layer```. Give it the ```cobweb```\r<img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/cobweb.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker.\rThen, select the trap token and activate its 'ItsATrap_trapCreationWizard' token macro.\rThis will present a menu for setting up the trap's configurations.\r\r### Activating traps:\r\rIf a token moves across a trap at ANY point during its movement, the trap will\rbe activated!\r\rA trap can also be manually activated by clicking the 'Activate Trap' button\rin the trap's configuration menu.\r\r### TrapThemes:\r\rTrapThemes are used to provide support for formatting messages for traps and\rautomating system-specific trap activation and passive search mechanics.\r\rIf you are using the One-Click API Library, you can specify which theme to use\rin the ```theme``` user option.\r\rBy default the ```default``` theme will be used. This is a very basic,\rsystem-agnostic TrapTheme which provides support for the basic TrapEffect properties\rand has no passive search mechanics.\r\rAdditional system-specific themes will be made available as their own API scripts.\rIf you would like to implement a TrapTheme for your system, take a look at\rthe ```default``` or ```5E-OGL``` TrapThemes as an example to get you started.\r\r### Support\r\rIf you experience any issues while using this script or the trap themes, or if\ryou have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3280344/script-its-a-trap-v2-dot-3\r",
